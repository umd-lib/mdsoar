# MD-SOAR Database Restore

**Note:** The following steps describe retrieving a MD-SOAR DSpace database
snapshot from Kubernetes for use with MD-SOAR for local development.

1) Switch to the Kubernetes namespace from which the database snapshot
   should be retrieved (the following example uses the Kubernetes "test"
   namespace):

   ```bash
   $ kubectl config use-context test
   ```

2) Run the following command to run "pg_dump" in the "drum-db-0" Kubernetes pod,
   placing the database dump in the `postgres-init` subdirectory:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl exec drum-db-0 -- pg_dump -O -U drum -d drum > postgres-init/drum.sql
    ```

3) (Optional) This step can be skipped, if you are following the instructions in
   [dspace/docs/DockerDevelopmentEnvironment.md](DockerDevelopmentEnvironment.md).

   Start the "dspacedb" container and wait for the restore to complete.

    ```bash
    $ docker compose -p d9 up -d dspacedb
    ```

    To determine if the restore is complete, run the following command, and wait
    for the "ready to accept connections" message:

    ```bash
    $ docker logs -f dspacedb
    ...
    ...
    ... LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
    ```

    Hit `<Ctrl-C>` to exit the "docker logs" command and return to the terminal.
